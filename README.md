# zkMonopoly-beta
zkMonopoly on zkVerify uses ZK proofs for a single-player Monopoly. Players roll a die on a 16-tile board to gain/lose SMONO tokens. Burn tokens at thresholds (500, 1000, etc.) to earn XMONO points (1, 3, 6, etc.), capped at 5,000, expandable by admin. zkVerify ensures private, fair validation.
